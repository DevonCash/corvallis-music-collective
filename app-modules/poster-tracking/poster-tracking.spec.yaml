overview: >
  The Poster Tracking module enables venues and event organizers to track the physical distribution 
  of promotional materials through QR codes. Users can generate batches of unique QR codes for their 
  posters, print them, and track where each poster has been placed. The system captures the location 
  of each poster through the first scan, providing an elegant way to track poster placement without 
  requiring manual input. The module focuses on secure data collection and poster tracking, while 
  integrating with the Analytics & Insights module for detailed analysis.
