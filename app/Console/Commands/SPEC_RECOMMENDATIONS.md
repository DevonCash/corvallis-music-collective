# Recommendations for Specification Format

Based on the implementation of the `spec:test-coverage` command, here are some recommendations to make specification files easier to parse and analyze:

## Requirement Definitions

1. **Consistent Formatting**: Use a consistent format for requirement IDs and descriptions:
   ```markdown
   - **REQ-001**: The system shall maintain detailed profiles for each practice space.
   ```

2. **Unique IDs**: Ensure each requirement has a unique ID in the format `REQ-XXX` where XXX is a three-digit number.

3. **Clear Type Indicators**: Always include one of the following keywords in the requirement description:
   - `shall` for mandatory requirements
   - `should` for recommended requirements
   - `may` for optional requirements

4. **Structured Metadata**: Use a consistent structure for requirement metadata:
   ```markdown
   - **REQ-001**: The system shall maintain detailed profiles for each practice space.
     - **Priority**: High
     - **Acceptance Criteria**: Room profiles contain complete information with at least 5 descriptive fields.
   ```

## Traceability Matrix

5. **Consistent References**: When referencing requirements in the traceability matrix, use the same format as in the requirement definition:
   ```markdown
   - **REQ-001**:
     - **Test ID**: TEST-001
     - **Task ID**: TASK-001
   ```

6. **Avoid Empty Descriptions**: In the traceability matrix, include a brief description or reference to the original requirement:
   ```markdown
   - **REQ-001**: Room Profiles
     - **Test ID**: TEST-001
     - **Task ID**: TASK-001
   ```

7. **Consistent Indentation**: Use consistent indentation for traceability matrix entries:
   ```markdown
   - **REQ-001**:
     - **Test ID**: TEST-001
     - **Task ID**: TASK-001
   
   - **REQ-002**:
     - **Test ID**: TEST-002
     - **Task ID**: TASK-002
   ```

## Related Requirements

8. **Structured References**: When referencing related requirements, use a consistent format:
   ```markdown
   - **Related Requirements**: REQ-001, REQ-002, REQ-003
   ```

9. **Validate References**: Ensure all referenced requirements exist in the specification.

## General Recommendations

10. **Machine-Readable Format**: Consider using a more machine-readable format for specifications, such as YAML or JSON, with Markdown for human-readable documentation:
    ```yaml
    requirements:
      - id: REQ-001
        description: The system shall maintain detailed profiles for each practice space.
        type: mandatory
        priority: High
        acceptance_criteria: Room profiles contain complete information with at least 5 descriptive fields.
        related_requirements: [REQ-002, REQ-003]
        tests: [TEST-001]
        tasks: [TASK-001]
    ```

11. **Consistent File Structure**: Use a consistent file structure for specification files:
    ```
    module-name/
    ├── module-name.spec.md
    ├── tests/
    │   ├── Feature/
    │   └── Unit/
    ```

12. **Automated Validation**: Implement automated validation of specification files to ensure they follow the recommended format.

13. **Version Control**: Include version information in the specification file:
    ```markdown
    # Module Name Specification
    
    **Version**: 1.0.0
    **Date**: 2023-05-01
    **Status**: Draft
    ```

14. **Requirement Grouping**: Group related requirements together with clear section headers:
    ```markdown
    ## 4.1 User Authentication
    
    - **REQ-001**: The system shall require user authentication before allowing access.
    - **REQ-002**: The system shall support multi-factor authentication.
    
    ## 4.2 User Authorization
    
    - **REQ-003**: The system shall implement role-based access control.
    ```

By following these recommendations, you'll make it easier for automated tools to parse and analyze your specification files, which will improve traceability between requirements and tests.
