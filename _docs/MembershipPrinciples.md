# Membership Principles for Module Design

## Core Philosophy

As a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting the local music community, our approach to membership benefits should reflect our mission and values. Rather than implementing arbitrary feature restrictions across membership tiers, we will focus on cost-based considerations that align with our non-profit status and community-focused goals.

## Guiding Principles

### 1. Maximum Access, Minimum Barriers

- **Default to Inclusion**: Most features should be available to all members by default
- **Focus on Sustainability**: Restrictions should primarily exist where there are real costs or resource constraints
- **Community First**: Prioritize solutions that benefit the community as a whole

### 2. Cost-Based Restrictions

Membership tiers should primarily reflect differences in:

- **Resource Consumption**: Features that consume significant organizational resources
- **Operational Costs**: Services that require staff time or physical resources
- **Financial Risk**: Activities that create potential financial liability
- **Replacement Costs**: Access to high-value equipment or resources

### 3. Trust and Relationship Building

- **Tenure Recognition**: Long-term members may earn additional privileges through demonstrated reliability
- **Contribution Recognition**: Members who contribute time, expertise, or resources may receive enhanced access
- **Community Standing**: Established members with positive history may face fewer restrictions

### 4. Fair Resource Allocation

- **Need-Based Priority**: Allocate limited resources based on project needs rather than membership tier
- **Demonstrated Proficiency**: Access to specialized resources based on skills and experience
- **Project Merit**: Consider the community benefit of projects when allocating scarce resources

## Application Across Modules

### Member Directory Module

- **Basic Profiles**: Available to all members
- **Enhanced Services Marketplace**: Commission rates may vary based on membership contribution
- **Featured Status**: Based on community contribution and engagement rather than tier

### Band Profiles Module

- **Basic Profiles**: Available to all bands
- **Digital Press Kit**: Available to all, with potential storage limits based on actual costs
- **Tour Management**: Available to all, with potential support services tiered by cost

### Productions Module

- **Event Planning Tools**: Available to all members
- **Resource Allocation**: Priority based on project needs and community benefit
- **Support Services**: Tiered based on actual staffing and resource costs

### Community Calendar Module

- **Event Submission**: Available to all members
- **Featured Events**: Based on community relevance rather than membership tier
- **Promotion Services**: Tiered based on actual promotional costs

### Publications Module

- **Content Submission**: Open to all members
- **Editorial Support**: Allocated based on content quality and community interest
- **Print Inclusion**: Based on space constraints and content merit

### Resource Lists Module

- **Access to Information**: Available to all members
- **Contribution Rights**: Based on expertise and demonstrated knowledge
- **Featured Listings**: Based on community validation rather than membership tier

### Gear & Inventory Module

- **Equipment Access**: Available to all, with security deposits based on equipment value
- **Borrowing Limits**: Based on equipment availability and maintenance costs
- **Consignment Services**: Commission rates reflecting actual operational costs

## Implementation Guidelines

When designing module features, consider:

1. **Is this restriction necessary?** Does it reflect a real cost or constraint?
2. **Is there a cost-recovery alternative?** Can we use deposits, usage fees, or other mechanisms instead of feature restrictions?
3. **Does this align with our mission?** Will this approach help us better serve the music community?
4. **Is it fair and transparent?** Can we clearly explain the rationale to our members?

## Membership Tier Structure

While avoiding arbitrary feature restrictions, we still maintain membership tiers to support organizational sustainability:

### Basic Membership
- Access to all core features and services
- May require deposits or usage fees for high-cost resources
- Standard rates for services with operational costs

### Supporting Membership
- Reduced deposits for equipment and resources
- Discounted rates for services with operational costs
- Recognition of financial contribution to the organization

### Sustaining Membership
- Minimal deposits for most resources
- Lowest rates for services with operational costs
- Priority consideration when resources are constrained
- Recognition as a key supporter of the organization's mission

## Conclusion

By focusing on cost-based considerations rather than arbitrary feature limitations, we create a membership structure that aligns with our non-profit mission while ensuring organizational sustainability. This approach maximizes community access to valuable resources and services while acknowledging the real costs and constraints of operating our platform and physical space.
