# Membership Principles for Corvallis Music Collective

## Core Philosophy
The Corvallis Music Collective is a community-driven non-profit focused on making music creation accessible to everyone. Our membership system reflects this mission by minimizing artificial barriers while ensuring sustainable operations.

## Guiding Principles

### 1. Community Access Over Paywalls
- **Default to Inclusion**: Core features and resources should be available to all members
- **Resource-Based Limitations**: Restrictions only where tangible costs or scarcity exists
- **Community-Centered Design**: Prioritize solutions that strengthen our music community

### 2. Cost-Justified Tiering
Membership tiers should primarily reflect differences in:
- **Resource Usage**: Access to physical spaces and equipment (real operational cost)
- **Resource Consumption**: Features requiring staff time or physical resources
- **Financial Sustainability**: Services with direct monetary costs to the organization
- **Replacement Risk**: Access to high-value equipment or resources

### 3. Contribution Recognition
- **Volunteer Credit System**: Members earn additional access through volunteer hours
- **Skill Contribution**: Teaching, mentoring, and equipment maintenance as alternative currency
- **Community Investment**: Long-term members build trust and expanded access privileges

### 4. Equitable Resource Distribution
- **Need-Based Allocation**: Prioritize access based on project requirements
- **Skill-Appropriate Access**: Match specialized equipment with demonstrated proficiency
- **Community Impact**: Consider potential community benefit when allocating limited resources

## Decision Framework

When implementing any feature restriction, consider:
1. **Is there a real cost?** Does this feature consume finite resources?
2. **Is there an alternative?** Can we use deposits or time credits instead of tier restrictions?
3. **Does this support our mission?** Will this approach make music more accessible?
4. **Is it transparent?** Can we clearly explain this policy to our community?

## Membership Structure Principles

- **Multi-Tiered Approach**: Provide options at different contribution levels
- **Value at Every Level**: Ensure meaningful benefits at each tier
- **Cost Alignment**: Tier differences reflect actual resource usage costs
- **Contribution Recognition**: Higher tiers receive reduced deposits and expanded access
- **Community Recognition**: Acknowledge those who contribute more to our sustainability
- **Transparent Pricing**: Clear explanation of how membership fees support our mission

## Volunteer Credit System

- Members can contribute time and expertise to earn credits
- Credits can offset usage fees, extend borrowing periods, or reduce deposits
- Leadership roles receive additional credit multipliers
- System recognizes both financial and time contributions equally

## Success Metrics

- Member retention across all tiers
- Resource utilization rates
- Volunteer hour contributions
- New member acquisition
- Community diversity metrics
- Financial sustainability indicators
