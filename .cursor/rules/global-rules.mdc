# Corvallis Music Collective

## Tech Stack:
    - Tailwind CSS / DaisyUI
    - AlpineJS
    - Livewire
    - Filament 3
    - Laravel 11
    - PostgreSQL

## Module Development
The project is divided into modules, each in the `app-modules` 

The main app module (in the `app` directory) covers the following features:
    - User authentication
    - Laravel Policies
    - Filament Panel Registration

Any other features should be implemented in separate modules.

Tables for each module should be prepended with the module name, e.g. `practice_space` => [`practice_space_rooms`, `practice_space_bookings`]

## Test Driven Development

Follow the principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD) when writing code.

- When creating a new feature, first write a test for its smallest unit, then implement that. Iterate this process until the feature is complete.
- When debugging an issue, first write a test which reproduces the issue, then modify the code to fix the issue. These tests should go in a separate category called "Regressions"

- Use the command `php artisan spec:test-coverage` to check tests against the specification.
