# About Corvallis Music Collective

Making music shouldn't be complicated or expensive. We're a community of musicians and music lovers who believe that everyone should have the chance to create, practice, and perform. Our mission is simple: building and connecting music communities in the Corvallis area.

## Our Core Beliefs

**Music Belongs to Everyone**  
High quality equipment, practice space, and music education shouldn't be limited to those who can afford it. By sharing resources and expertise, we make it easier for anyone to be part of our music community.

**Every Scene Enriches Our Community**  
From metal shows to classical ensembles, indie bands to electronic artists â€“ each adds something unique to Corvallis's musical landscape. By bringing these communities together, we create opportunities for collaboration and inspiration.

**Resource Sharing Builds Stronger Communities**  
Musical resources work better when they're shared. By pooling our equipment, spaces, and expertise locally, we help more people participate in making music and strengthen our creative community.

**Young Musicians Need Diverse Pathways**  
Traditional music education works for some, but not for everyone. We work to provide alternative paths for young musicians to explore their interests, connect with mentors, and find their musical community.

## Our Vision

We envision a Corvallis where:

- Different musical communities learn from each other and collaborate
- Live music thrives in accessible, welcoming spaces
- The joy of making music is available to everyone, regardless of background or experience
- Resources are shared, maximized, and put to good use

## What We Offer

At the heart of our organization is our community rehearsal and performance space, a vibrant hub where musicians can practice, collaborate, and perform. Through our membership program, we provide access to quality rehearsal spaces, performance opportunities, and a supportive community of fellow musicians.

Join us in building a more connected, accessible, and vibrant music scene in Corvallis. Everyone is welcome here.
